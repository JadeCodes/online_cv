Online CV - Project 1
====
**Objective** 

To create an online version of my current CV.

**Method**

These are the steps I took to complete this:

1. Brainstorm ideas and sketch low and high fidelity wireframes
2. Break ideas down into different stages for current skill level vs. future skill level
3. Choose color pallet using Adobe Kuler Color Wheel
    - Custom color pallet - https://kuler.adobe.com/Online-CV-(1)-color-theme-3926340/ 
4. Choose fonts using Google Fonts
    - Codystar - https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Codystar (used for main heading)
    - Droid Sans - https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans (used for all sub-headings and text)
5. Select free social media icon images and then edit in Photoshop to match color pallet
    - Source for icons - http://tinktank.in/free-flat-social-icons/ 
6. Create an infographic and then edit in Photoshop to match color pallet
    - I used Piktochart to create my infographic -  http://piktochart.com/ 
7. Write HTML for first version of CV in Sublime Text 2
8. Write CSS for first version of CV in Sublime Text 2

**End Goal**

For the first version of my online CV I would like to achieve the following:

* Clean, easy to read code in both HTML and CSS
* Simple harmonious design
* Use CSS properties correctly to achieve design ideas
* Adding google analytics for tracking site traffic
* GitHub Pages set up with personal URL
* Use Photoshop to edit images
* Create a responsive page for any screen size

**The Future**

This is the first version of my online CV and also the first time I have created a web page from scratch and used Photoshop. I am keen to revisit this project in a few weeks to test some new skills.
